## Ongoing Tasks

- Backend setup:
  - Database migration execution with real SQLite (when needed)
  - Testing backend API endpoints with mock database
- Frontend implementation:
  - Fixing TypeScript errors in components
  - Improving UI/UX
- Post creation and scheduling UI
- Discord embed preview
- Scheduler implementation

## Pending Tasks

- Testing
- Debugging
- Deployment configuration
- Documentation
- Installing Visual Studio build tools for better-sqlite3 (if needed for production)

## Known Issues

- Native module compilation issues with better-sqlite3 on Windows
  - âœ… Workaround implemented: Mock database for development
  - For production: Install Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with C++ desktop development workload
  - Alternative: Use older Node.js version (Node 18 recommended) with compatible better-sqlite3 version
- TypeScript errors in frontend components due to missing module declarations
- Need to install required npm packages:
  - react
  - react-hook-form
  - lucide-react
  - lodash.debounce

## Development Instructions

### Running Backend with Mock Database

1. Set up the mock database:

   ```bash
   node setup-mock-db.js
   ```

2. Run the test server (minimal implementation):
   ```bash
   node run-test-server.js
   ```
3. Or run the full server with mock database:

   ```bash
   node run-with-mock.js
   ```

4. Access the health endpoint to verify the server is running:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/health
   ```

### Running Frontend
